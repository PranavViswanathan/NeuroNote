# Decisions Log (Non-Plan Additions)

This file captures implementation notes and additions that are useful context but do not change the executable project plan.

Architectural decisions are tracked in `docs/plan.md` under `Architecture Decisions`.

## 2026-03-07
- Documentation policy alignment:
  - `docs/decisions.md` stores non-plan additions and operational notes.
  - `docs/plan.md` remains the source of truth for architecture and implementation sequencing.
- Hardening follow-through notes:
  - Removed unused placeholder package file `api/src/app/models/__init__.py`.
  - Removed unused web note state helper in `web/src/lib/state/note-store.ts` after TipTap path consolidation.
- Tooling/runtime note:
  - In this environment, `uv run` intermittently panics with a system configuration error.
  - Validation fallback used `api/.venv/bin/ruff`, `api/.venv/bin/mypy`, and `api/.venv/bin/pytest` with equivalent scope.

## 2026-03-07 (Containerized Workflow)
- Containerized orchestration addition:
  - Added a Docker Compose workflow where API execution remains `uv`-based but runs inside containers.
  - Added `infra/api/Dockerfile` and `infra/scripts/api-entrypoint.sh` to run `uv sync` before API commands.
  - Added compose-focused Make targets (`compose-up`, `compose-check`, `compose-test`, `compose-migrate`, etc.).
  - Added `web` service to compose stack for browser-level local validation from one command.
  - Added configurable port bindings (`DB_PORT`, `API_PORT`, `WEB_PORT`) to avoid host port conflicts.
  - Updated documentation to make compose-first workflow the default run/check/test path.

## 2026-03-07 (Epic E4 Delivery Notes)
- Added `entity_aliases` persistence for canonical mapping memory and conflict handling.
- Added resolver preview API endpoint to expose unresolved entities for optional confirmation flow.
- Added alias bootstrap utility (`api/src/app/db/bootstrap_entity_aliases.py`) for seed imports.

## 2026-03-10 (Permanent Migration Safety)
- Set `DB_AUTO_CREATE` default to `false` to favor migration-owned schema lifecycle.
- Added PostgreSQL startup guard so `initialize_database()` does not run `create_all` for Postgres URLs.
- Made Alembic revision `20260307_0002` idempotent when `entity_aliases` and indexes already exist.

## 2026-03-10 (Processing Transaction Safety)
- Fixed `NoteProcessingService` transaction scope so alias index reads and graph writes execute under one explicit transaction.
- Added unit regression test for the `A transaction is already begun on this Session.` failure path.

## 2026-03-11 (Epic E5 + Title Flow Delivery Notes)
- Added `note_title` to note persistence, contracts, API payloads, and editor autosave flow.
- Added idempotent migration `20260311_0003_note_title` for existing databases.
- Added graph sync delete-and-replace by `source_note_id` and typed graph-edge writing.
- Added startup async backfill service and `/v1/backfill-status` API route.
- Added dedicated unit/integration coverage for graph sync relation collapse, backfill status, startup backfill async behavior, and note-title migration.
- Local web test runtime still has an esbuild platform mismatch in `web/node_modules`; validated frontend tests in compose runtime (`docker compose ... run --rm web npm run test`).

## 2026-03-12 (Embedding Schema Safety)
- Fixed graph embedding persistence to always target `public.note_embeddings` instead of relying on session `search_path`.
- Added compatibility copy-forward from `ag_catalog.note_embeddings` to `public.note_embeddings` inside repository table bootstrap.
- Added regression test ensuring note embeddings land in `public` schema.
